1.PROJECT TITLE 

Blinkit Grocery Sales Analysis Dashboard | Power BI Project


2.📝 PURPOSE

This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard developed using a simulated dataset representing sales performance across various Blinkit grocery outlets. The goal is to derive actionable insights about product types, outlet performance, customer ratings, and visibility impact — all packaged in a visually intuitive dashboard. This project is ideal for learning retail analytics, data visualization, and dashboard design using Power BI


3.TECH STACK

a)Microsoft Excel – For structured tabular dataset

b)Microsoft Power BI – For data modeling and visual dashboard creation

c)DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures and KPIs

4.DATA SOURCE

Source : kaggle

Contains fields like:
Item Type, Fat Content, Item Weight, Visibility
Outlet Type, Size, Location Tier, Establishment Year
Sales, Ratings, and Identifiers for items and outlets

Data cleaned and processes to stimulate real world Blinkit style grocery sales data for better analysis

5.FEATURES

a) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Clearly displayed metrics such as Total Sales, Average Rating, Total Items Sold, and Total Average Sales offer a snapshot of overall performance.

b). Fat Content and Health Category Analysis
Donut and bar charts compare sales revenue and item distribution across Low Fat vs Regular items, offering insight into health-conscious buying behavior across outlet tiers.

c) Outlet-Based Insights
Breakdowns by Outlet Type (Supermarket Type 1–4, Grocery Store), Outlet Size (Small, Medium, High), and Outlet Location Type (Tier 1, 2, 3) allow performance comparisons across store formats.

d)Item Type Performance
Visual hierarchy of product categories (e.g., Fruits, Snacks, Dairy, Beverages, Health products) based on revenue helps identify top-selling segments, aiding inventory and marketing strategy.

e) Item Visibility & Rating Impact
Visuals show how product placement (visibility) and customer ratings affect sales outcomes, enabling better product display strategies and customer satisfaction analysis.

6.ANALYSIS

°The dashboard reveals a strong correlation between outlet type and total revenue, with Supermarket Type 1 leading in both sales and average item ratings. This indicates customer preference for larger or well-stocked formats.

°Item visibility has a measurable impact on sales, with highly visible items generating higher revenue despite similar weights or fat content. This underlines the importance of product placement strategy in retail environments.

°Low Fat items performed nearly as well as regular items in total sales, suggesting that health-conscious products are gaining traction even in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.

°The Outlet Establishment Year vs. Revenue graph shows newer outlets (post-2015) achieving better revenue growth, possibly due to improved supply chains or targeted expansion.


7.PROJECT LEARNINGS
a) End-to-End Dashboard Development

Gained hands-on experience in building a complete dashboard from raw Excel data to final polished Power BI visuals.

b) Data Cleaning & Transformation

Learned how to structure and refine messy or minimal datasets to make them analysis-ready within Power BI.

c) Visualization Best Practices

Applied effective design principles — clean layout, meaningful color schemes (Blinkit brand colors), and intuitive slicers for better user experience.

d) DAX Measure Formulas

Developed custom calculations like average rating, visibility impact, and segmented totals using DAX functions.

e) Retail Domain Insight
Understood how key variables such as outlet size, item type, visibility, and fat content can influence consumer behavior and business strategy.
